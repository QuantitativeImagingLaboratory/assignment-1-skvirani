Problem 1a)
    Nearest neighbor algorithm used rounding techniques to determine the intensities of the newly mapped pixels. At higher scales, image quality suffered.
    Pictures became more granulized and lost its meaning at some point. Became a blur at high scaling
Problem 1b)
    Bilinear interpolation algorithm uses linear interpolation algorithm multiple times to pinpoint a pixel in 2D space. The image that is outputed has a
    much finer granulization of the pixels. It looks much smoother in comparison to nearest neighbor algorithm. This is due to the fact that the newly mapped
    pixels are much more accurate in their intensities because they take an average of the nearest pixels as opposed to the actual intensity of the nearest
    pixel
